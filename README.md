## Update 2025
I abandoned this project. It was supposed to be a texture pack where everything looked the same, so you would have to read the labels to find out which item is which. Then you can change the language to one that you don't fully know to practice / learn that language. It would be interesting if someone made a video speedrunning Minecraft with such a texture pack.

# minecraft-texture-pack-reading
A texture pack that forces players to read the item names.
